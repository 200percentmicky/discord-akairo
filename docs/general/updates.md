# Changes in this fork of akairo

## for support regarding this pr you can ping @tricked in akairo discord general or preferably join [my discord](https://discord.gg/KkMKCchJb8) and ask there

## Slash commands

For slash commands to work you need to add `execSlash` to the command, and when it recieves a slash command it will run `execSlash`.

New slash command related events:

> these are all emitted by the command handler

- slashError
- slashBlocked
  - owner
  - superuser
- slashStarted
- slashNotFound
- slashGuildOnly
- slashMissingPermissions
  - user
  - client

> Cooldown event will also run on slash commands

For more info about these events view the [source code](https://github.com/SkyBlockDev/discord-akairo/blob/master/src/struct/commands/CommandHandler.js#L408). If you don't want to do that, you can safely assume that they are the exact same as their non-slash versions, execpt all `Message` arguments are changed to `CommandInteraction`.

Slash command example:

> Slash commands are turned into messages like objects to make interacting with them easier the original ineraction is maintained though at message.interaction

```ts
import { Command } from "discord-akairo";
import {  Message, User } from "discord.js";
export default class slashCommand extends Command {
    public constructor() {
        super("slash", {
            aliases: ["slooosh", "slash"],
            // Args generated by akairo
            args: [
				{
					id: "member",
					type: "member"
					match: "content",
				},
			],
            //Slash command options you are going to have to register yourself
			options: [
				{
					type: 6,
					name: "member",
					description: "the member you want to greet",
					required: true,
				},
			],
        });
    }
    exec(message: Message, { member }:{ member:GuildMember }) {
       message.reply(`Hello ${member}!`)
    }
}
```

Note that this example assumes a few things.

1. You already have a registered slash command called `avatar`
2. The registered command has one option named `user`, and
   1. The type is `6` (enum value for user)
   2. Required is `false`

Message.util.send/reply doesnt work on slash commands to know whats a slash command use message.util.slash, true if true

slash option in commands is just so you can know if a command is slashed for yourself

You can do this all manually using something like an eval command, or just making the http requests to the discord api yourself, or making it automated, but just keep in mind that the library won't register anything for you. Read [this](https://github.com/MatteZ02/discord-interactions) or [this](https://discord.js.org/#/docs/main/master/class/ApplicationCommandManager?scrollTo=set) for how to create/edit/delete slash commands in discord.js.

### Emphemeral responses

If you are unaware, an emphemeral response is what causes the "Only you can see this" response with slash commands. You can cause the command to do this with the `slashEmphemeral` command option. Just add `slashEmphemeral: true` and it will respond privately.

Warning: fetchReply will not work with emphemeral responses.

## Tasks

Yes this fork has tasks!

Example:

```ts
//bot.ts
import { TaskHandler } from "discord-akairo"
....
taskHandler: TaskHandler = new TaskHandler(this, {
	directory: join(__dirname, "..", "tasks"),
});
....
this.taskHandler.loadAll();
this.taskHandler.startAll();
...
```

```ts
//tasks/task.ts
import { Task } from "discord-akairo";
export default class extends Task {
	constructor() {
		super("hello", {
			delay: 200,
			runOnStart: false
		});
	}
	async exec() {
		console.log("hello from", this.client.user.username);
	}
}
```

## Superusers

SuperUsers example:

```ts
constructor(config: Option) {
		super({
			ownerID: config.owners,
			superUserID: config.superUsers,
		});
	}
```

```ts
constructor(config: Option) {
		super({
			ownerID: config.owners,
            //Owners arent automatically added as superuser
			superUserID: [...config.owners,...config.superUsers],
		});
	}
```

## Auto defer

Auto defer automatically defers a message aka "BotName is thinking"

```ts
commandHandler: CommandHandler = new CommandHandler(this, {
	directory: join(__dirname, "..", "Commands"),
	prefix: "!",
	//To disable it
	autoDefer: false
});
```

## Removed features

- Providers
  - mongo
  - sequelize
  - sqlite

If you want a good database, we recommend using an ORM like sequelize. Databases aren't hard to set up by themselves, and are much more convienent when used without being limited by providers.
